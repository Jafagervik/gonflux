# GonFLUX - A statically typed multi paradigm Language written in ZIG
===============================================================

## Why GonFLUX

Generally, programming language with support for concurrency and parallelism
is not so trivial to understand. Rust, C, C++ are all great and powerful languages,
but writing solid parallizable and concurrent code is not so easy.

Despite not being purely functional, as little code as possible should 


Languages such as Elixir, Scala, Oz and Haskell all have support for concurrency,
but the goal of GonFLUX is to create syntax more similar to python or julia, 
but with statically type checking and still being fully functional.

## Why ZIG

Zig is excellent when it comes to cross compilation. This makes it easy to make 
this work on every single target set.
If we need to add  in C code, it's interop with both C and C++ is really easy, 
making it great to work with for anyone no matter if you've written zig or not.
It also has more memory safety than C, as well as more types, more builtins.

Also, and this might be the main point. We want to study how it is like creating 
new languages using newer languages. Historically, C and C++ has been the languages
of choice if you wanted to make languages. Now, with languages such as Rust, Odin and Zig,
we can see how development of languages is from a developers experience.


## Main aspects of this language

- Multiparadigm
- Statically typed 
- Easy-to-learn syntax
- Built in support for concurrency and parallelism
- Process and thread managment should be trivial 
- A robust and easy to integrate standard library


## Core philosofy

This language should be able to create robust applications, while
also being one to easily teach people about aspects such as atomics, processes,
semaphores, mutexes, threads, multicore programming, distributed programming and so on


## Creation

This project is handled by Uedalab, a computer science lab at Waseda University in
Tokyo, Japan, under the guidance of prof. UEDA, Kazunori.
